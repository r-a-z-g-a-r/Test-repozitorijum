				<p id="prologue">Before we go any further into talking about industrial music and the artists that have been making it, I feel it's somewhat important to make a decent definition of what that name entails.</p>
				
				<p>Looking at the bottom half of the "industrial music family tree", created by a combination of musicians stating their influences and journalists doing that for them, could understandably lead you into believing that it doesn't take much to make your music "industrial". Making matters more complicated is the unavoidable fact that, in the more-or-less 45 years since people first realized that certain groups of musicians were doing something special, industrial music (in the most general sense) at a certain point ended up spanning pretty much the entire spectrum of popularity, or in layman's terms, "mainstream"-ness. As a predictable result, changes to it were made accordingly. The more popular it was, the more it resembled pop music in some way or another. Simply put, there's no point in buying a Marilyn Manson album expecting it to sound like Whitehouse (if you don't recognize those names, well, making sure you do is to sort of theoretically become the point of this site).</p>
				
				<p>It doesn't matter how much creative freedom those more popular artists genuinely had, it doesn't matter how much being on a major label was actually making them lose their edge; with every commercial example of a style of music, there inevitably comes a legion of fans of the less commercial stuff ready to unleash a merciless verbal beatdown of the mainstream stuff for daring to sell out and dumb down their favourite genre, and certainly not ready to hold back their nervous breakdown whenever someone might potentially hear them say they listen to industrial music, and then have the <i>nerve</i> to reply with "Oh, like Nine Inch Nails?"</p>

				<p>Obviously, this isn't meant to be a derision of those that don't like more commercial industrial music. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions on things, but there always comes a point where people tend to get a bit... militaristic about it all. That's already irritating, but the fact that the topic at hand is music and other people's opinions on it just makes it extra unbearable. If you see anyone like that willing to pull as many people as possible into their endless debate on what is and isn't "true" industrial music, just know that all you're gonna get from it is a headache.</p>
				
				<p>This may have been a slight digression, but I hope I've decently summarized some of the nuances and annoyances that make defining industrial music with words a bit difficult (then again, the same could be said for all music). Taking all this into account, and having the knowledge that I do on a good amount of the music that has been christened with the "industrial" label, I feel confident enough to at least be able to give a good general idea of what industrial music can be.</p>
				
				<div class="collapse">
					<h2>So, what is it, then?</h2>
					<button class="toggle" id="1">Collapse</button>
				</div>
				
				<div id="definition">
					<p>As far as I, the person writing this, am concerned, arguably the most essential part of any style of industrial music can most succinctly be described in two words: <b><i>urban decay</i></b>.</p>
					
					<p>What do I mean by that? Well, by 'urban', I'm mainly talking about recalling images of any sort of artificial creation from after the, uh, Industrial Revolution. Usually not after the digital revolution, though. That's more of a techno thing. 'Decay' should be more obvious: the music needs to sound like it's either in a state of decay, or reminiscing on decay. It is something that inherently brings a bad and/or negative attitude to the whole thing, but that's exactly why they do it that way.</p>
					
					<figure class="figure2"><img src="images/williamsburroughs.jpg" alt="William S. Burroughs">
						<figcaption>William S. Burroughs - avant-garde poet, godfather of almost all things countercultural post-WW2, and an important name to remember as you read on.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>This brings me adequately into the next most essential part of industrial music: the <i>countercultural</i> desire to <b><i>provoke</i></b>. To question and go firmly against several modern societal norms, mainly of the more conservative variety. Having a strong interest in covering anything from simple sexual deviancy to topics like murder and fascism; it all adds up to something you wouldn't necessarily want to lull your baby to sleep to.</p>
					<p>Even the most mainstream industrial acts were perfectly able to anger a good number of right-wing American congresspeople into calling for their censorship or banning, along with accusing them of convincing children to shoot up their schools (because if there's anything conservatives can keep doing without fail, it's uselessly finding scapegoats and making big stinks that everyone will forget about in a month at most). As with most things of a similar nature and high profile, it's not hard to see that those acts gained the worldwide fame that they did precisely <i>because</i> of their ability to provoke, rather than in spite of it. The position of being in a major label certainly helped in that regard, but that can almost be seen as a springboard with acts like this.</p>
					
					<p>Still, as an industrial musician, provocateurship won't get one far if the "urban decay" aspect isn't down under lock and key. If you're good at that, you're free to do whatever you want. Use as much or as little electronic or literal metal instrumentation as you want, fuse it as much with other genres as you want; at the very least, people will call the result "post-industrial" or say that it has industrial elements. If you can stand that, you're hunky dory.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Now that the basics are out of the way, we can jump right into the next big question some might have already asked by now...</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="collapse">
					<h2>How did this all begin?</h2>
					<button class="toggle" id="2">Collapse</button>
				</div>
				
				<div id="punk">
					<p>Well, first, a bit of background might be necessary.</p>
					
					<p>As could have been figured out by now with a decent memory and the knowledge of basic mathematics, industrial's origins can most reasonably be traced back to around the middle of the 1970's. This was the time when a phenomenon known as <b>punk rock</b> started to become something a lot of people were doing (mostly throughout the USA, Britain and a bit more sparsely in mainland Europe and Australia). The time when the first wave of musicians, whose lives were changed at the end of the previous decade by the likes of the <b>Stooges</b> and the <b>Velvet Underground</b>, were getting the attention of more than just dedicated clubgoers; when their records were getting put on what was for them quite an engrossing amount of store shelves. For some, like New York's <b>Ramones</b>, this was being done by the relatively high-profile Sire Records (an imprint of Warner Bros.), while across the Atlantic, the <b>Clash</b> even got the attention and became a mainstay of CBS.</p>
					
					<p>Major labels aside, these outfits were still given the freedom to make everything about their music more or less as they pleased, and as they had already been doing before. What they were doing was, even just musically, quite highly radical for their time. It may not seem like that nowadays, but after over 5 years of white guys in lion manes giving the public either:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>chains of stolen Willie Dixon standards with guitar solos longer than how long the vocalist says his "third leg" is, or</li>
						<li>double albums where every side of both vinyl records is taken up by a song each, where the band's combination of Richard Wagner and English folk stories about Gerald the Gnome is complemented by synth solos that take up 50% of the entire thing (the other half is guitar solos again)</li>
					</ol>
					<p>...the general public ended up seeing the more simplified and regressive approach the punks were giving them (no solos, no songs more than 3 minutes long, using a 4th chord in the song would be kinda pushing it) as ironically quite progressive.</p>
					
					<p>Of course, the thing that made the punks <i>truly</i> radical had to be their image and worldview. The whole thing was a counterculture, after all, and they were not ones to be in any way opaque about what they liked and didn't like about society. In fact, thinking about the stereotypical image of the punk with embroidered patches ironed all over their leather jackets, you could say some of them were literally wearing their thoughts on their sleeves.</p>
					
					<p>This worldview was, similar to what we elaborated on before, something that could seriously put any old right-winger's britches in a bunch. The most mainstream punks of the late 70's were indeed able to cause a very similar uproar to what the most mainstream industrial musicians of the 90's could after them. Question the <b>Sex Pistols</b>' authenticity as much as you'd like (Lord knows I do my fair share of that every now and then), but the scandals they caused were all in all able to show the world what a punk could be capable of doing with a profile as high as they had at their prime.</p>
					
					<p>Even still, all of this mattered very little (if at all) to the underground art/music world the aforementioned punks had just left behind. Whether this was the catalyst or not, in the moment punk went mainstream, half of the underground had already exploded with new groups more than ready to move forward from the whole "three chords and the truth" approach (while the other half was more focused on making that faster and more aggressive, but that's another story). Every group had differed from the other in some way. Some were more atonal than others, some more funky, some more depressing, almost anything you could think of was free game. In what seemed to some like the blink of an eye, <b>post-punk</b> was born.</p>

					<p id="motivation">Now, this was all well and good, but this is the part where our sights finally begin to settle on a specific group of "post-punks" (as I'll be calling them now). These post-punks were coming in with, even for punk standards, a rather <i>severe</i> disillusionment for virtually everything about modern society and life in general. They had been checking up as much as they could on what punk and the underground were about at that point, and they had come out of it with one conclusion: it was mostly full of pansies.</p>
					
					<dl>
						<dd>"What on Earth did we just walk into?! You're all still using guitars and drums? Verses and <i>choruses? Chords and scales?!</i> Bloody hell, <i>that's</i> what you picked up from the Velvet Underground? Our <i>grannies</i> are more subversive than you!"</dd>
					</dl>
					
					<p>The rest of the post-punks were showing a tiny bit more promise, at least with their krautrock influence ("krautrock", for those unaware, being a frankly quite ridiculous term for a particular brand of highly experimental and usually minimalistic brand of progressive rock that hailed from Germany, which I really want to believe kept its name for as long as it did partially because the punks of the day <i>seriously</i> didn't want to admit to themselves that they enjoyed prog rock), but everything else about them was still unsatisfactory ("Reggae elements? You <i>must</i> be joking.") and, again, just too <i>song</i>-like.</p>
					
					<p>They'd just become witness to the perfect opportunity, flashing into existence right in front of their eyes. The time has come for these particular post-punks to teach the underground a lesson on what it <i>actually</i> means to be subversive, to deviate from the norm, to shock and provoke truly nasty thought; the way <b>Frank Zappa's Mothers</b> would have wanted things to progress.</p>

					<p>Will it be enjoyable, or even <i>listenable</i>, to anyone other than the most open-minded of people? Ha! Who are they to give two rat's behinds? In fact, if these groups had picked anything up from the dadaists, it's that most people obviously don't <i>deserve</i> those two qualities in art to begin with (yeah, this is the kind of artist we're dealing with here)! As long as the artists themselves enjoy what they're putting out, that's all that matters! So, they were as free as a bird to take from the schools of nobody but <i>the</i> most relentlessly boundary-pushing musicians and artists they knew about. And seeing as a good few of these post-punks, such as <b>Throbbing Gristle</b>'s Genesis P-Orridge, had at that point participated in the performance art world for the last half a decade, it only makes sense that their proto-industrial pantheon was already formed.</p>
					
					<p>Let's spare a section to explain who I mean before we continue (we'll get to the end of this soon, I promise).</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="collapse">
					<h2>The proto-industrial pantheon (generally speaking)</h2>
					<button class="toggle" id="3">Collapse</button>
				</div>
				
				<div id="pantheon">
					<p>Now, the high-brow art sphere has always been very well known for consistently producing quite tough pills for its audience to swallow (sometimes to the point where it circles right back around to being dumb again), especially since the turn of the 20th century (bearing witness to the most rapid societal &amp; technological changes and most soul-crushing warfare in human history can do that to people), but it seems to be after the end of World War II where its field of music in particular had grown to acquire arguably its most eccentric, controversial, and most revolutionary roster. Pretty much as soon as the dust had settled and the terrain for the Cold War was complete, artists all over the world (but mostly the West, as per usual) were flooding out of the woodwork, continuing where composers like Schoenberg and Messiaen had left off (if they even had them in mind), where they would eventually introduce methods of composition few could have even dreamed of, going into territories the average person could only describe as baffling.</p>
					
					<figure class="figure2">
						<img src="images/johncage.jpg" alt="John Cage">
						<figcaption><b>John Cage</b> placing his hand suspiciously around the neck of a cat.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<p>From the German <b>Karlheinz Stockhausen</b> composing with hall acoustics and... things just being left to chance, to <b>Pierre Schaeffer</b> from France composing with recordings of everyday sounds, to <b>Iannis Xenakis</b> from Greece composing with mind-boggling mathematic processes, to <b>John Cage</b> from America composing with concepts that delve quite deeply into the abstract (his most infamous composition instructing an orchestra to play <i>literally nothing</i> for exactly 4 minutes and 33 seconds, the duration of which inspired its name), these people had every intention of almost completely dismissing all older methods of creating academic music (which some of them felt had become tainted, as had the rest of the past's culture, by the horrors of the war), heavily challenging everything people thought they knew about music as a whole and basically stretching the definition of that word as far as it could possibly go.</p>
					
					<p>Now, there was plenty to take from the theoretical side in this area, but what ultimately most grabbed the industrialists' attention (I think I can call them that now) was the innovations these composers introduced to instrumentation, and the results they brought. As you can probably make out by now, for artists this clearly willing to tear down the very foundations all music up to then had been standing on, it was clear they were eventually going to come up with a piece of music where strings &amp; horns were simply not going to cut it anymore. Schaeffer's ideas of compositions made from recordings were obviously going to require a tape recorder of some sort be used as a musical instrument.</p>
					
					<p>This was just one example of the avant-garde embracing new technologies that were giving everyone new possibilities anyway, with their endless curiosity encouraging them to find out what it could give them and their art. This would most famously lead a significant portion into creating studios full of electronic test equipment repurposed into essentially making up all the elements a modern synthesizer has, with their methods eventually being tidied up and streamlined by others into more digestible musical instruments, leading to the synth, by the end of the 60's, becoming as ubiquitous a part of an average music studio as the grand piano.</p>
					
					<p>Of course, the industrialists were way more intrigued by what the avant-garde was creating, rather than what others created in their wake. The synthesizer had clearly been placed well into the confines of conventionality at this point, and the industrialists were as eager as ever to retread the muddy waters of ruthless experimentation others had treaded before them. They felt the sea bed was still full of ground-breaking ideas just waiting to be re-evaluated in a punk context, and it was going to start with the way they looked at instrumentation.</p>
					
					<p>This isn't to say they were against simply the usage of more conventional synths on principle. In fact, not only was that way easier to do at this point, but they probably got some enjoyment out of how doing so might potentially upset some of the other punks (hoping to provoke them almost as much as everyone else), who had come to see the instrument as inherently bourgeoisie, in no small part due to the prog rockers that used it. While the industrialists may have somewhat understood the sentiment, the sheer prevalence of synths in pretty much all industrial music from that point onward made it obvious how unfair, and blind to a synth's true capabilities, they considered it.</p>
					
					<p>However, in addition to synths, what was just as essential a part of pretty much all "first-wave industrial" music had to be the other musical instruments they used, many of these being rather unconventional objects, and with some going as far as to wire up their own electronics. This can easily be seen as not only a call back to what the avant-garde composers had been doing in search of new sounds, and therefore potentially new music, but as a reminder to a specific point they tried to make by getting all that test equipment in the first place: <i>literally everything</i> in some fashion or another has the potential to become a musical instrument, to evoke an emotion or provoke thought through sound (the aforementioned 4'33" could be interpreted to state that this even extends to ambient noise, or just bodily functions you can't control). All it really takes is an open and creative enough mind.</p>

					</figure>
					
					<p>The influence these composers had on industrial music can arguably most clearly be seen on <b>John Cage</b>'s series of "Imaginary Landscape" compositions. The first of the five started off calling for people to play a regular cymbal and piano (albeit by manipulating its strings directly), but also to be joined by two variable-speed turntables with records on them playing a constant tone. This would be followed by the second and third in the series calling for, among other things, tin cans, a bigger metal trash can, sine wave generators, an electromechanical buzzer and an amplified coil of wire. The fourth and fifth ones would call for 12 live radios and 42 turntables with no limit as to what exactly they'll be playing, respectively. I may have already made my point here, but almost all of these are instruments that could be acquired hilariously easily, either by going to a hardware store or similar such establishment, or if you want to spend even less, by rummaging through the streets or in a landfill; very inspirational things for the punk in any aspiring musician. Not only can music evidently be made with these objects, but the industrialists saw in using them an inherent aesthetic that would come to guide them forever after: one calling to mind a heavily industrialized city that has since been abandoned and drained of any signs of life. A factory in ruins. A system having already fully turned its workers into drones. Humanity having failed and mutilated an environment needed to survive, where all that's left is the coldness and dirt of urban capitalist life.</p>
					
					<p>It's what they were kind of seeing all around them already, and they felt it was time to create a music that truly and semi-consciously reflected upon that. The music most people were listening to had become obsolete <i>because</i> of its "beauty", not in spite of it. Whether anyone was going to listen to their efforts or not, a capsule of how things really were was necessary for these musicians. It was time for cold and uncaring soundscapes, for a cold and uncaring world. <b>Industrial music for industrial people.</b></p>
